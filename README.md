npm install
npm install -g react-native-cli

"npm run start" in one console
run "react-native run-ios" in another console.
wait for it...........it takes a bit to load the build.
if it fails on the simulator just press reload.  the build is huge so it tries
to run the build before its loaded sometimes.
